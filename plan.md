# Repository Alignment Plan

This placeholder plan captures the key activities required to keep the documentation, code scaffolding, and data assets synchronized. Each checkbox is intentionally descriptive so future contributors understand the intent behind every folder that now exists.

- [x] Describe the local-first vision in `README.md` and link to `FrontArc.md`/`BackArc.md`.
- [x] Scaffold data + ETL assets that mimic AWS Glue outputs in the `data/` and `support_analytics/` folders.
- [x] Provide FastAPI-ready backend skeleton inside `backend/app/` with routers, services, and repositories mapped to the blueprint.
- [x] Provide Next.js-ready frontend skeleton under `frontend/` with placeholder routes, hooks, and providers.
- [x] Keep tests, visualization references, and scripts in dedicated folders so each discipline can iterate independently.
- [ ] Replace placeholders with production-ready logic once the AWS migration begins.
